# gribscan Magicians

The dataset building process in gribscan is based on the idea, that each GRIB message should be
placed somewhere into an imaginary multi-dimensional shelf, which is spanned by datasets, variables
and coordinates. The Magician is a tool to customize the decisions required within that flow from GRIB messages to datasets.
To do so, there are a couple of methods which can be implemented and hook into the flow:

```{diagrams}
from diagrams import Cluster
from diagrams.programming.flowchart import Document, Decision, Database, ManualLoop, Action
from sphinx_diagrams import SphinxDiagram

with SphinxDiagram(title="magician dataflow"):
    messages = [Document(f"message {i}") for i in range(1,4)]
    
    with Cluster("for each dataset"):
        with Cluster("for each key"):
            varhook = Action("variable_hook()")
        with Cluster("for each coord"):
            coordhook = Action("coord_hook()")
        m2key = Decision("m2key()")
        (m2key
         >> Database("store by key")
         >> varhook
         >> Action("extra_coords()")
         >> coordhook
         >> Action("globals_hook()")
         >> Document(f"references"))

    messages >> Decision("m2dataset()") >> m2key

```

## properties

### dimkeys
`dimkeys` is a tuple that specifies all dimension names that are used to construct the return value `dimension_key` by `m2key`.

## methods

### m2dataset
```python
def m2dataset(self, meta):
    return dataset_name
```

`m2dataset` is run once per GRIB message and must determine into which dataset the message will go. The `meta` input is the full information from the GRIB index.
Everything after is treated separately for each dataset.

### m2key

```python
def m2key(self, meta):
    return variable_key, dimension_key
```

`m2key` is run once per GRIB message in each dataset. It must return a two-element `tuple`, where the first is used to determine in which variable the message will end up and the second will determine the coordinates of the message, e.g. the corresponding timestamp and vertical level.

### variable_hook

```python
def variable_hook(self, key, info):
    return {}
```

After grouping all the messages by `key`, `variable_hook` is called once per unique `variable_key`.
It can be used to update the `info`-dict containing information about the variables' name, shape, dimensions, attributes etc...
The `info`-dict passed into this method will contain the following keys:

* `dims`: tuple containing dimension names across GRIB messages (i.e. `dimkeys`, but unit-sized dimensions are skipped)
* `shape`: shape across GRIB messages
* `dim_id`: tuple with indices into the original `dimkeys`
* `coords`: tuple of iterables containing all discovered coordinate values along each dimension
* `data_shape`: list of shape within a GRIB message (use the special value `__from_data_dims__` to infer the shape from the dimension names provided through `data_dims`)
* `data_dims`: list of dimension names within a GRIB message
* `dtype`: (numpy-) datatype of the values
* `attrs`: attributes for the variable,
* `extra`: extra properties from the GRIB index file

Everything returned by this method will be merged back into the initial `info` passed into the method.

### extra_coords

```python
def extra_coords(self, varinfo):
    return {"coord_name": [1,2,3,4]}
```

The argument of `extra_coords` is a dictionary from `key` to (updated) `info` for all variables.
It must return a dictionary, which may contain additional coordinates to the dataset.
The values must be numpy-like arrays.

### coords_hook

```python
def coords_hook(self, name, coords):
    return attrs, coords, array_meta
```

`coords_hook` will be called once per output coordinates (both, automatically generated and extra).
Arguments are the `name` and the coordinate values (i.e. as would be returned by `extra_coords`).
It must return a tuple consisting of an attributes dict, the (maybe modified) coordinate values and a dict containing metadata to be merged into the `.zattrs` dictionary of the final zarr.

### globals_hook

```python
def globals_hook(self, global_attrs):
    return global_attrs
```

`globals_hook` can be used to modify global attributes of the final dataset.
